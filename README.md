👋 Hi there, [I am](https://rafael.codes) a full-stack software consultant [from Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/UOim8), living and [working in Oslo, Norway](https://www.scienta.no). I am [specialized on the Java platform](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/raphw) but I do generally [enjoy any kind of programming](https://dzone.com/articles/dev-week-rafael-winterhalter). I am fairly active in developing open source software and I believe in writing clean, modular code. I am regularly [blogging about technology](https://mydailyjava.blogspot.com/). I also [enjoy speaking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJZg_b40WSWxixd7J57zPQRky9ReSRbCV) at conferences and user group meetings and was pronounced a [Java One Rockstar](https://blogs.oracle.com/javaone/entry/javaone_2014_rock_stars). I am the author of [Byte Buddy](http://bytebuddy.net), a runtime code generator for the Java virtual machine and won a [Duke's Choice award](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/dukes-award-102815.html) and a [Groundbreaker award](https://developer.oracle.com/groundbreakers/) for my efforts. I also created [documents4j](http://documents4j.com), a document format converter for Java. For my contributions to the ecosystem, I was elected a [Java Champion](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/entry/new_java_champion_rafael_winterhalter). [Get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelwth), if you [want to talk](https://twitter.com/rafaelcodes) with me about something that you think that I [could help you with](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1237575/raphw).
