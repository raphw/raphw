ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, [I am](https://rafael.codes) a full-stack software consultant [from Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/UOim8), living and [working in Oslo, Norway](https://www.scienta.no). I am specialized on the Java platform but I do generally enjoy any kind of programming. I am fairly active in developing open source software and I believe in writing clean, modular code. I am regularly [blogging about technology](https://mydailyjava.blogspot.com/). I also [enjoy speaking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJZg_b40WSWxixd7J57zPQRky9ReSRbCV) at conferences and user group meetings and was pronounced a Java One Rockstar. I am the author of [Byte Buddy](http://bytebuddy.net), a runtime code generator for the Java virtual machine and won a Duke's Choice award and a Groundbreaker award for my efforts. I also created [documents4j](http://documents4j.com), a document format converter for Java. For my contributions to the ecosystem, I was elected a [Java Champion](https://javachampions.org/members.html). Get in touch if you [want to talk](https://bsky.app/profile/rafaelcodes.bsky.social) with me about something that you think that I [could help you with](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1237575/raphw).
